# Car Price Detection  

## Overview  
This project implements machine learning models to **predict car prices** based on various features such as **brand, model, year, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and condition**. By analyzing historical car price data, the model provides accurate price estimations for used and new vehicles.

## Features  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizes correlations between car features and price.  
- **Machine Learning Models**: Uses regression-based algorithms for price prediction.  
- **Web API Integration**: Enables price predictions via a simple web API.  
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Measures model accuracy using RMSE and R² score.  

## Installation  
To set up the project, clone this repository and install dependencies:  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/car-price-detection.git
cd car-price-detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage  
1. **Prepare the dataset**: Place car listings in the `data/` directory.  
2. **Train the model**:  
   ```bash
   python train_model.py --epochs 50 --batch_size 32
   ```
3. **Predict car price**:  
   ```bash
   python predict_price.py --brand "Toyota" --year 2020 --mileage 30000
   ```

## Model Architecture  
The project supports multiple **machine learning models**, including:  
- **Linear Regression**: A simple approach using feature weights for prediction.  
- **Random Forest & Gradient Boosting**: Tree-based ensemble methods for better generalization.  
- **Neural Networks**: Deep learning-based models for complex feature relationships.  

## Evaluation  
- **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**: Measures prediction accuracy.  
- **R² Score**: Determines how well the features explain car prices.  
- **Feature Importance**: Highlights the most influential attributes in price determination.  

## Results  
The trained model provides reliable car price predictions. Example results can be found in the `results/` directory.
